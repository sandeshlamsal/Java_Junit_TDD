Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short 
development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired 
improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the 
new code to acceptable standards.

The following sequence of steps is generally followed:

Add a test
Run all tests and see if the new one fails
Write some code
Run tests
Refactor code
Repeat
